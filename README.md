# Overview

The lab procedure document includes 7 different prompt options. Folks can go in-depth with one prompt or explore a couple of prompts. 

As a starting place, the Electronic Frontier Foundation has [a useful primer](https://www.eff.org/pages/face-recognition) for how facial recognition technologies work.

# Prompt 1: Further Background Research

In 2016, Georgetown University Law School's Center on Privacy and Technology researchers Claire Garvie, Alvaro Bedoya, and Jonathan Frankle published ground-breaking research on law enforcement use of facial recognition technologies. 

["The Perpetual Lineup: Unregulated Police Face Recognition in America"](https://www.perpetuallineup.org/) emphasizes the number of open questions around law enforcement use of facial recognition technology.

<blockquote><p>"We know very little about these systems. We don’t know how they impact privacy and civil liberties. We don’t know how they address accuracy problems. And we don’t know how any of these systems—local, state, or federal—affect racial and ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>"This report closes these gaps. The result of a year-long investigation and over 100 records requests to police departments around the country, it is the most comprehensive survey to date of law enforcement face recognition and the risks that it poses to privacy, civil liberties, and civil rights. Combining FBI data with new information we obtained about state and local systems, we find that law enforcement face recognition affects over 117 million American adults. It is also unregulated. A few agencies have instituted meaningful protections to prevent the misuse of the technology. In many more cases, it is out of control."</p></blockquote>

Spend some time looking through the report. Start with the Executive Summary, but dig into the report's analysis and recommendations sections.

Questions to consider:
- What do the Gender Shades authors say about this research? 
- What stands out from reading the executive summary?
- What questions, topics, or issues were the authors looking at? 
- What research methods or approaches did the authors use?
  * Particularly, how did the authors go about gathering information for their analysis?
- What conclusions do the authors draw from their analysis?
- Other questions/comments/etc

# Prompt 2: Tech Deep Dive

Our content for this week mentions different types of facial recognition technologies (face detection, classification, emotion detection, etc) as well as specific companies and products. Select a specific type of technology, company, or product, and do a deep dive using the question prompts below as a starting point.
- Folks can also explore a benchmark image dataset used to train facial recognition models.

# Prompt 3: Exploring the Gender Shades Lit Review

The Gender Shades authors reference a wide range of prior work that relates to their study. For this prompt, select one of these articles to read/explore further.

# Prompt 4: NIST System Audits

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has ongoing work with Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT) research.
- Learn more about NIST's ["Face Projects"](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/face-projects) research and initiatives.
- Learn more about NIST's ["FRVT"](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/face-recognition-vendor-test-frvt-ongoing) ongoing work, including additional technical documentation.

NIST has produced a number of technical whitepapers from the FRVT program.

- NISTIR 8271 ["FRVT Part 2: Identification"](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8271) (September 2019) builds on and expands NIST Interagency Report (NISTIR) 8238, which documents NIST's evalaution of facial recognition algorithms.

- You can also read the original NISTIR 8238 publication ["Ongoing FRVT Part 2: Identification"](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8238) (November 2018).

But, most recently, NIST released NISTIR 8280 ["FRVT Part 3: Demographic Effects"](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8280) (December 2019), which "describes and quantifies demographic differentials for contemporary face recognition algorithms. NIST has conducted tests to quantify demographic differences for nearly 200 face recognition algorithms from nearly 100 developers, using four collections of photographs with more than 18 million images of more than 8 million people. Using both one-to-one verification and one-to-many identification algorithms submitted to NIST, the report found empirical evidence for the existence of a wide range of accuracy across demographic differences in the majority of the current face recognition algorithms that were evaluated" (["New FRVT Demographic Effects Report"](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/face-recognition-vendor-test-frvt-ongoing)).

Questions to consider:
- What questions, topics, or issues were the authors looking out? What did they set out to do?
- What types of prior work do they reference? How do they engage with that work (critique, build on, etc)?
- What are some of the authors’ main arguments or findings?
- What research methods or approaches did the authors use? What steps did they take to answer their original research questions?
- What conclusions do the authors draw from their analysis (of prior research, benchmark datasets, or commercial systems)?
- Other questions/comments/etc

# Prompt 5: Congressional Hearings and Federal Reports

There have been a number of federal reports and hearings on facial recognition technologies, in relation to questions of privacy and civil liberties. For this prompt, select one or two of these reports or hearings and explore the linked material.

[Click here](https://github.com/kwaldenphd/facial-recognition/blob/main/congressional-hearings-reports.md) for more details on this option.

# Prompt 6: Lawsuits

CNET's Alfred Ng has a great overview of some of the legal challenges being posted to facial recognition technologies.
- Alfred Ng, ["Facial recognition's fate could be decided in 2021"](https://www.cnet.com/news/facial-recognitions-fate-could-be-decided-in-2021) *CNET* (11 December 2020)

Each prompt has some reflection questions to consider as a starting place. 

We'll combine the lab notebook and reflection for next week, so your reflection can combine or synthesize the work that happened in the lab as well as readings/class meetings.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has ongoing work with Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT) research.

Learn more about NIST's ["Face Projects"](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/face-projects) research and initiatives.

Learn more about NIST's ["FRVT"](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/face-recognition-vendor-test-frvt-ongoing) ongoing work, including additional technical documentation.

NIST has produced a number of technical whitepapers from the FRVT program.

NISTIR 8271 ["FRVT Part 2: Identification"](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8271) (September 2019) builds on and expands NIST Interagency Report (NISTIR) 8238, which documents NIST's evalaution of facial recognition algorithms.

You can also read the original NISTIR 8238 publication ["Ongoing FRVT Part 2: Identification"](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8238) (November 2018).

But, most recently, NIST released NISTIR 8280 ["FRVT Part 3: Demographic Effects"](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8280) (December 2019), which "describes and quantifies demographic differentials for contemporary face recognition algorithms. NIST has conducted tests to quantify demographic differences for nearly 200 face recognition algorithms from nearly 100 developers, using four collections of photographs with more than 18 million images of more than 8 million people. Using both one-to-one verification and one-to-many identification algorithms submitted to NIST, the report found empirical evidence for the existence of a wide range of accuracy across demographic differences in the majority of the current face recognition algorithms that were evaluated" (["New FRVT Demographic Effects Report"](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/face-recognition-vendor-test-frvt-ongoing)).

##  Senate Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law (July 2012)\

In July 2012, The Senate Judiciary Committee Subcomittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law heled a hearing "What Facial Recognition Technology Means for Privacy and Civil Liberties." The hearing included testimony from Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Trade Commission, Facebook, MorphoTrust USA, Carnegie Mellon University, National Sheriffs' Association, and Duke University representatives.

## Federal Bureau of Investigation Privacy Impact Assessment (May 2015)

In May 2015, the FBI issued an internal study, "Privacy Impact Assessment for the Facial Analysis, Comparison, and Evaluation (FACE) Services Unit," which considered privacy implications for FACE Services Unit applications.

The report was made public via Freedom of Information/Privacy Act request.

## Updated FBI Privacy Impact Assessment (July 2018)

The FBI released an update to the May 2015 report in July 2018.

The report was made public via Freedom of Information/Privacy Act request.

## United States Government Accountability Office Report (May 2016)

In May 2016, the United States Government Accountability Office published GAO-16-267, a report titled "Face Recognition Technology: FBI Should Better Ensure Privacy and Accuracy." The report was addressed to then Sen. Al Franken, who was at the time the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law, part of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

## U.S. GAO-19-579T Report (June 2019)

The GAO released a follow-up report to GAO-16-267 in June 2019. That report, titled "Face Recognition Technology: DOJ and FBI Have Taken Some Actions in Response to GAO Recommendations to Ensure Privacy and Accuracy, But Additional Work Remains." The report was addressed to members of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.

## Committee on Homeland Security "About Face" Hearing (July 2019)

In 2019, the House Committee on Homeland Security convened a hearing titled "About Face: Examining the Department of Homeland Security’s Use of Facial Recognition and Other Biometric Technologies." The hearing included testimony from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Secret Service, Transportation Security Administration, and National Institute of Standards and Technology (U.S. Department of Commerce) representatives.

Following the publication of NISTIR 8280 (see Prompt #3), Rep. Bennie G. Thompson (D-MS), Chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, [wrote a public letter](https://homeland.house.gov/news/correspondence/chairman-thompson-writes-dhs-on-shocking-facial-recognition-report) to then Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf regarding the discrepencies between the NIST report and the testimony provided by DHS.

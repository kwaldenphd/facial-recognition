# Overview

Our content for this week mentions different types of facial recognition technologies (face detection, classification, emotion detection, etc) as well as specific companies and products. Select a specific type of technology, company, or product, and do a deep dive using the question prompts below as a starting point.
- Folks can also explore a benchmark image dataset used to train facial recognition models.

Questions to consider:
- How (and why) was this technology developed?
  * Or how was this image dataset collected?
- Who all was involved, or where did it originate?
- What can you tell about how the technology works?
  * In the case of technology products, what can you tell about how the facial recognition system was built or trained?
  * In the case of benchmark datasets, what can you tell about how the images where gathered (and the level of transparency/informed consent involved)?
- Where is this technology used?
  * Or, where/how is this image dataset used?
- Where and how do you see race and surveillance at work?
  * Connections with class content or discussions
- Other observations/comments/questions
